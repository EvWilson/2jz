# Pong example

This is my super simple demo to proof-of-concept what using this ECS library
might look like in a simple game.

### Prerequisites

You must have SDL2 and its dev dependencies available on your system.

DISCLAIMER: I have likely only built this example on Linux, specifically
Pop!_OS 20.10. You have been warned.

### Building the game

From within this directory, run `zig build demo`

TODO:
handle w/s up/down input events
render system, movement system
